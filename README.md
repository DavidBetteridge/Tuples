# Linda Tuple Space for .NET

A distributed coordination system based on the Linda coordination language, featuring remote execution via Roslyn scripting and C# Source Generators.

## Architecture

The system consists of four main components:

1.  **TupleServer**: A TCP-based server that manages multiple named "tuple spaces". It supports atomic coordination primitives like `IN` (consume), `OUT` (produce), and `RD` (read).
2.  **TupleClient**: A library providing the `TupleSpaceClient` for interacting with the server.
3.  **ExpressionRunner**: A distributed worker that polls an `expressions` tuple space for C# code strings to execute against specific tuple spaces.
4.  **TupleClient.Generators**: A C# Source Generator that allows developers to write type-safe code for remote execution.

## Core Operations (Linda Primitives)

The `TupleSpaceClient` provides the following operations. Both string-based and generic type-safe APIs are supported.

### String-Based API

| Operation | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `OutAsync(params string[] tuple)` | **Produce**: Adds a tuple to the space. |
| `InAsync(params string[] pattern)` | **Consume**: Blocks until a tuple matching the pattern is available, then removes and returns it. |
| `RdAsync(params string[] pattern)` | **Read**: Blocks until a tuple matching the pattern is available, then returns it without removing it. |
| `InpAsync(params string[] pattern)` | **Probe Consume**: Non-blocking version of `IN`. |
| `RdpAsync(params string[] pattern)` | **Probe Read**: Non-blocking version of `RD`. |

*Patterns support wildcards using the `"*"` string.*

### Generic API (Type-Safe)

The generic API uses C# structs to represent tuples. When using generics, the name of the struct is automatically prepended as the first element of the tuple in the tuple space.

```csharp
[TupleDefinition]
public struct TaskTuple 
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public int Priority { get; set; }
}

// Writes ("TaskTuple", "task-1", "10") to the space
await client.OutAsync(new TaskTuple { Id = "task-1", Priority = 10 });

// Reads back a TaskTuple with exact values
var task = await client.InAsync<TaskTuple>("task-1", 10);

// Use Wildcard.Any for pattern matching
var anyTask = await client.InAsync<TaskTuple>(Wildcard.Any, Wildcard.Any);
```

Generic methods include `OutAsync<T>`, `InAsync<T>`, `RdAsync<T>`, `InpAsync<T>`, and `RdpAsync<T>`. Structs used with the generic API should be marked with the `[TupleDefinition]` attribute if they need to be available for remote evaluation.

### Wildcard Matching

For pattern matching in generic methods, use `Wildcard.Any` instead of the string `"*"`. This provides type safety and avoids ambiguity when a tuple value might actually be the literal string `"*"`.

```csharp
// Match any TaskTuple regardless of Id or Priority
var task = await client.InAsync<TaskTuple>(Wildcard.Any, Wildcard.Any);

// Match a specific Id with any Priority
var task = await client.InAsync<TaskTuple>("task-1", Wildcard.Any);
```

### Compile-Time Validation

The `TupleClient.Generators` package includes a Roslyn analyzer that validates generic tuple method calls at compile time:

- **TUPLE001**: Reports an error if the number of pattern parameters doesn't match the number of properties in the tuple struct.
- **TUPLE002**: Reports an error if a parameter type doesn't match the corresponding property type (unless `Wildcard.Any` is used).

```csharp
[TupleDefinition]
public struct TaskTuple 
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public int Priority { get; set; }
}

// ✓ Correct: 2 parameters matching 2 properties with correct types
await client.InAsync<TaskTuple>("task-1", 10);

// ✓ Correct: Wildcard.Any can match any type
await client.InAsync<TaskTuple>(Wildcard.Any, Wildcard.Any);

// ✗ Error TUPLE001: Wrong number of parameters
await client.InAsync<TaskTuple>("task-1");

// ✗ Error TUPLE002: Type mismatch - Priority expects int, not string
await client.InAsync<TaskTuple>("task-1", "high");
```

## Bulk Operations

To improve performance when adding many tuples, use the `BulkOutScope`:

```csharp
using (var scope = new BulkOutScope(client))
{
    await client.OutAsync("key", "value1");
    await client.OutAsync("key", "value2");
    // Only OUT operations are allowed in this scope
}
```

## Remote Execution (`RunRemotelyAsync`)

The system supports a powerful `RunRemotelyAsync` mechanism that allows code to be shipped to a remote `ExpressionRunner` for execution close to the data.

### 1. Define Remote Logic
Mark a static method with the `[RemoteEval]` attribute. The method must take a `TupleSpaceClient` as its first argument (usually named `c`).

```csharp
public static class MyLogic
{
    [RemoteEval]
    public static async Task PerformWork(TupleSpaceClient c)
    {
        var data = await c.InAsync("data", "*");
        // ... process data ...
        await c.OutAsync("result", "processed");
    }
}
```

### 2. Invoke Remotely
The Source Generator automatically extracts the method body as a string and puts it in a `RemoteCode` class. Use `RunRemotelyAsync` to send this code to the runner:

```csharp
await client.RunRemotelyAsync(RemoteCode.PerformWork);
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
dotnet run --project TupleServer/TupleServer.csproj
```

### 2. Start the Expression Runner
You can start multiple runners to handle parallel workloads.
```bash
dotnet run --project ExpressionRunner/Program.cs
```

### 3. Run the Addition Example
The `Addition` project demonstrates summing numbers 1 to 1000 by distributing addition tasks across the runners.
```bash
dotnet run --project Addition/Program.cs
```
